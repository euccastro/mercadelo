# mercadelo

Supporting software for a [mutual credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit) [complementary currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_currency), based on [LETS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system) but with a twist: each participant emits their own currency. 

## Installation, Usage, etc.

Not nearly there yet.  At this stage, this is mostly a playground for the concepts.  If you're interested, take a look at the [docs](https://github.com/euccastro/mercadelo/blob/master/doc/intro.md).  Tests and code are in flux and not too readable at this moment.
